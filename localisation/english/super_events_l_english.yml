sp_event_bruderkrieg:0 "Second Bruderkrieg"
sp_event_bruderkrieg_QUOTE:0 "The position of Prussia in Germany will not be determined by its liberalism but by its power. Prussia must concentrate its strength and hold it for the favourable moment, which has already come and gone several times. Since the treaties of Vienna, our frontiers have been ill-designed for a healthy body politic. Not through speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided—that was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849—but by iron and blood. \n- Otto von Bismarck"

A communist is by nature an internationalist, but he is also a patriot.
