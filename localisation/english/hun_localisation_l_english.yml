Hungary has already helped us in the Reunification War with dire needed arms and volunteers.

And so we shall help their goals and they shall help us."
 hung.1080.a:0 "Our comrades are welcome"

 hung.1081.t:0 "The Breakup of Romania"
 hung.1081.d:0 ""The Germans have contacted us. They suggest that we select Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej as the leader for the Socialist Republic of Romania."Kun looked at his closest friends in the room awaiting their responses.\n\nIstván Dobi was the first to respond."I would rather like someone who we can better control. Gheorghe is already well known in Romania and has his base of supporters."\n\nRákosi nodded and supported Dobi's assessment."I agree. If he is able to gain more popularity and support over the years he could potentially become a threat to our lands in Transylvania. We have already agreed that Romania shall never again threaten the borders of our nation again and we can not back down from that agreement already."\n\nKun excepted those reponses."Well I am unsure about him aswell and would rather have Ana Pauker but it is not up to us to decide who becomes leader of Romania and we can not risk our relationship with Germany over this matter."\n\nRákosi interrupted Kun."Incorrect my friend there are several things we can still decide. The Germans only specified that Gheorghiu-Dej should become leader of Romania but it was never stated that Romania shall not be divided."\n\nIstván quickly realized what Rákosi was proposing and continued his thoughts."You are suggesting that we also create puppet state of Moldovia?"\n\n"Yes! And with Ana Pauker as the leader. Of course we tell them it shall only be a "temporary situation" for the following years and that the two states will definetly unite again."\n\n"I pressume that shall not be the case, right?"\n\nRákosi put up a grim smile and continued."Correct! Over the years Gheorghiu-Dej and Pauker will have build up different regimes with their own ideologies and neither one of them will accept stepping down when the time comes for Romanian unification. This way we can easily make sure that Romania will never unite again, with the benefit of us barely intervening in the matter."\n\nKun felt uneasy hearing all of this."I am not sure if I can accept this... it is against the principles of internationalism and the Germans might..."\n\n"Kun you are a true Hungarian Revolutionary not a German one and you know this is necassary for Hungary, our nation."\n"Alright... if that is truly the best option." Kun sighed."
 hung.1081.a:0 "Is it not wonderful to paint to your own liking?"
 
 hung.1082.t:0 "War over Transylvania"
 hung.1082.d:0 "After diplomatic negotiations between Romania and Hungary over Transylvania had failed it was clear that war was inevitable. The Hungarian Peoples Republic has declared war on Romania claiming that they waging a war of liberation for the suppressed Hungarians and Transylvanians inside Romania's borders.\nThe international community however sees this as an another step of Hungarian warmongering aims to restore their old borders and, with the execption of Hungarians closest allies, fully condemn the declaration of war.\nFor now it is unclear if the Great Powers or other neighbours of Hungary will intervene in this conflict."

 hung.1083.t:0 "Escalation between Hungary and Serbia"
 hung.1083.d:0 "After diplomatic negotiations between the Serbian Government and the Hungarian Republic had failed over the Vojovodina issue failed some hoped that the situation would nevertheless escalate. These hopes have now been crushed. Hungary and Serbia are now at war and the war aims of Hungary have greatly increased. The Hungarian Peoples Republic now also declares to free the Croatians, Bosnians and Macedonians from Serbian dictatorship.\nFor now it is unclear if the Great Powers or other neighbours of Hungary will intervene in this conflict."

 #EventChain
 hung.1047.t:0 "A Night in Budapest - Part 1"
 hung.1047.d:0 ""Italian, from Sicily to be exact. I hope it suits your taste."\n\nKun watched as Rakosi filled up the glass. Mátyás Rákosi, the People's Commissar for Trade but rather known as the Commander of the Red Guard, had invited Kun to a dinner. Kun was aware that this was obviously a move to gain more influence rather then just an invitation to a friendly dinner. But Béla had recently no time for relaxation so he glady accepted the invitation. Furthermore a good opportunity to get information about what is going on in the Red Guard.\n\n"Thank You and how has work been?"\n\n"There is never a lack of it, that I can definetly tell you. Two days ago my men caught a Russian Spy who reaveled that they were trying to find people suitable for a New Government under Russian Control. Now guess with who they made contact with?\n\n"Who?"\n\n"Károlyi, the old bastard."\n\n"You are kidding right?"\n\n"He was always a rat, first he failed to secure our borders at the end of the war and even now he licks Russian boots."\n\n"I did not want him to be prosecuted during the purge, he was still our first president and had become a socialist who supported the revolution. The impact of his voice is minimal but his death could be bad puplicity".\nKun takes a sip from the Wine Glass and continues. "Well, I guess you can give out the arrest order and then we put him trial."\n\n"Ah that is already handled."\n\n"Already handled?""
 hung.1047.a:0 "The Dinner continues"

 hung.1048.t:0 "A Night in Budapest - Part 2"
 hung.1048.d:0 ""Already handled?"\n\n"Well yes, after receiving that information I immediatly ordered the Red Guard to remove him silently."\n\nKun's mouth dropped open slightly."Are you telling me you killed him without informing me or the Governing Council?!"\n\n"The faster, the better. Why? Is that a problem?" Rákosi continued with his meal as if nothing important happened.\n\nKun's face turned white and he slammed his fist on the table, visibly suprising Rákosi."You killed him without informing me or the council, of course it is a problem!\n\n"He still could have been a useful political tool and putting him on trial would have exposed his betrayal to the public. You do not decide who has to die. I do!"\n\nMátyás was somewhat startled by Kun's reaction but it did not disconcert him."I will admit, maybe I got a bit too comformtable with the daily routine. But you are too soft Kun. Our enemies can not have a chance to gather their forces, when I see an ill tree growing I immediatly cut it down. I just like to be efficient. And on the other hand it was just old Károlyi."\n\nKun calmed down. He was kinda right he should not make such a fuzz out of that old man."Alright... But next time you get any information of that sort you deliver it to me! Understood?"\n\n"Of Course, it will not happen again.""
 hung.1048.a:0 ""Long live the Republic""
