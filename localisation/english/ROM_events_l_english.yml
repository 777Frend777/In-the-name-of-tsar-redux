 news.5001.t:0 "Crisis in the Levant"
 news.5001.d:0 "Negotiations between the British Empire and diplomats bearing an ultimatum from the self-declared State of Israel have failed. War has broken out between the old empire and the young nation. Thousands of former Jewish militia have joined a united Israeli army to fight against the British. Leaders from across the Arab world have denounced the new country, some going so far as to threaten to invade along with the British. In spite of the danger, countless Jewish refugees from Europe are flocking to their new homeland. The future of this young nation is unclear, but no matter what happens, the repercussions will last well into the future."

This comes in response to an ultimatum, threatening war, from the Jews in the Mandate. With the Jewish state’s newfound independence, thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe are flocking to their new homeland. Although armed conflict has temporarily been avoided, many in the neighboring Arab nations are threatening war. What the future holds for the new Jewish state is unclear, but no matter what happens, this nation’s founding will change the region for a long time."

 iraqi.1.t:0 "Alliance with Iraq?"
 iraqi.1.d:0 "The Iraqi government has offered to sign an alliance, citing their wish to befriend their non-Arab neighbours. Considering our isolated position, it might be wise to consider this alliance. An extension of our diplomacy might be worthwhile. Of course, we can also leave the Iraqis on their own."
 iraqi.1.a:0 "Agreed"
 iraqi.1.b:0 "The Iraqis are on their own"
 iraqi.2.t:0 "Turkey accepts!"
 iraqi.2.d:0 "The Turkish have accepted our offer for an alliance! Brothers akin!"
 iraqi.2.a:0 "Good!"
 iraqi.3.t:0 "The Turkish declined!"
 iraqi.3.d:0 "The Turkish have rejected our most generous offer to ally them, we really should have beaten them to it."
 iraqi.3.a:0 "Blast!"
 iraqi.4.t:0 "Military leader Bakr Sidqi found dead!"
 iraqi.4.d:0 "One of our military leaders, Bakr Sidqi was found dead en route to Turkey in one of the air force bases in Mosul. A funeral will be held and he will be buried with full military honours."
 iraqi.4.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 iraqi.5.t:0 "King Ghazi has fatal accident"
 iraqi.5.d:0 "King Ghazi, our grand leader, has met his end during a fatal accident today involving his sports car. Allegedly, king Ghazi was murdered by Prime Minister Nuri al-Said due to his nationalist attitude. \n\nFortunately however, Ghazi's son, Faisal II is safe. However, he is underage, and as such, a regent needs to be installed. For now, this will be the late king's cousin, 'Abd al-Ilah."
 iraqi.5.a:0 "Well, could be worse."
 iraqi.6.t:0 "King Ghazi seizes power!"
 iraqi.6.d:0 "We've given the king too much power! He has unseated the government and dismissed the Prime Minister and subsequently granted himself executive powers. Any members of government will now be appointed by his majesty himself. \n\nIraq is slowly becoming more and more authoritarian and even leaning to fascism. Perhaps for the good of Iraq."
 iraqi.6.a:0 "Oh well."
 iraqi.7.t:0 "Military coup!"
 iraqi.7.d:0 "A military group of officers, self-called the Golden Square composed of three army colonels and one airforce colonel, has demanded that the current leader steps down and be replaced with a Prime Minister more compliant to their desires. \n\nAgreeing might throw our country into shambles, but who knows what might happen if we don't agree?"
 iraqi.7.a:0 "The Golden Square will remain unopposed"
 iraqi.7.b:0 "Iraq shall be free from this oppression!"
