 SIK_chaos_desc:0 "Order, Stability, Normality. Such words have become mystical in the minds of the people in the Clique. The people of Xinjiang are devastated. After several years of warfare, mixed with massacres and displacements, the entire country has been torn to shreds. But, since the end of the major fighting two years ago, the new Warlord of Death has not made any necassary efforts to rebuild the adminstration and restore something which resembles stability. He focuses rather on hunting down rivals and political enemies and investing most of the funds into his army. This status can not go on. The Qing Government in Beijing is regretting the deal with Ma and the Russians are thinking to restore order by themself."
 SIK_russian_pressure:0 "Russian Pressure"
 SIK_russian_pressure_desc:0 "The Tsardom of Russia is not pleased with the situation in Xinjiang. Xinjiang has always been a place in China for Russia to establish influence. May that be through trade, economy investments or transporting troops. When the conflict between, at that time, governor of Jin Shuren and Ma Zhongying escalated, the Russians initally wanted to support the more Russian friendly Jin. Though the government did not desire to start an expensive miltiary campaign again which might bring the Entente into the conflict. Furthermore after Ma Zhongying assured his loyalty to the Beijing administration, the Qing told Russia to not intervene on Jin's behalf. Ma Zhongying did thought not meet the Russian expectations. In fact he fullfilled none of them. Stability in the Clique has not improve a bit and Ma himself has immensly restricted Russian influence. The Tsardom is now again considering intervention for their own interests."
 SIK_turkic_unrest:0 "Uyghur Unrest"
 SIK_turkic_unrest_desc:0 "When Ma Zhongying came to Kubul and announced support for the fight of the people oppressed by Jin Shuren, the Uyghurs thought he was also supporting their cause of autonomy. But the Little Commander just used the Kumbul uprising as a mean to establish his own influence in Xinjiang. Promises to Kumul were thrown away and Ma Zhongying forces actively engaged conflict with other Uyghur forces, from the uprising Turkestan Republic. The Warlord has not given back the autonomy to the Kumulik Uyghurs and several of his forces are actively oppressing Turkisy, by force conscription or other brutal means. The situation has become unbearable for the Uyghur population and their hate grows more and more."
 SIK_destroyed_economy:0 "Destroyed Landscape, Economy, and Cities"
 SIK_destroyed_economy_desc:0 "What causes 4 years of brutal warfare, between warlords and several ethnicities, constant pillaging, destruction, and force conscription. A dead economy. Agriculture which barely exists, vanished buisnesses and any pasts attempts of industrialization are forgotten."

 sink.1000.d:0 "Sheng Shicai has approached us asking for support to reclaim his position of power in Sinkiang.\n\nAround 5 Years ago the Warlord Ma Zhongying approached the Qing Governement and asked for permission and support to overthrow the new governor of Sinkiang Jin Shuren. Jin Shuren had taken power in 1928 and had since then mismanaged the province and caused Muslim Revolts. Ma Zhongying wanted to fight for the Muslim Revolts and promised that through his managament the province would return to stability and stay loyal to the Qing. The Qing and us accepted and gave him support for his expedition.\n\nThe Fighting however lasted longer then thought with Jin Shuren and his Chief of Staff Sheng Shicai fighting back hard. Sheng Shicai later ursurped Jin Shuren and became leader of the remaining Clique Forces. Furthermore several Uyghur Revolts broked out which proclaimed independence intensifying the conflict even more.\n\n In late 1933 the fighting was largely over. After being defeated Sheng fled to Mongolia and the Uyghur Revolts were supressed. However... the province did not recover, especially under their new governor. Ma Zhongying did not reveal himself as a Unifier rather as a brutal tyrant and bandit. His troops frequently raid villages, he actively suppresses Han Chinese and Turkic Uyghurs brutaly and his administration is barely existing. Both Qing and Russia agree that he must be removed for the good of the province.\n\n And so when Sheng Shicai approached us for support to reclaim control of Sinkiang there was not a long debate. Russian Generals are creating a list of materials and men to be given to Sheng Shicai for his future campaign. However when Sheng regain control of the province he will be advised and "guarded" by our troops assuring that he acts in the interests of the Qing Government and ours."

 POLITICS_MA_ZHONGYING_DESC:0 "He was like the rider on the pale horse, which appeared when the fourth seal was broken; And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with hunger and death, and with the beasts of the earth. Once he was known as the Baby General or Little Commander, who fought with his own army in the territories in the Ma Clique. But he would soon lose this title with the Kumul Rebellion. Ma responded to the Kumulist plead for help and set off the biggest conflict, ever seen in the territories of Xinjiang. His campaign was one of brutality, death and oppression. In 1933 he declared himself, grudingly, loyal to the Beijing administration to avoid any outside intervention, from either Russia or the Qing themself. A year after he had overthrown the previous governor Jin Shuren and took control of Xinjiang. He suppresses Han Chinese and continues to oppress the Uyghur Majority. Hui Chinese, like him, are the only ones favored for higher ranks or government work. For most of Xinjiang he is the Herald of Death and it is not likely that he will change his ways."
