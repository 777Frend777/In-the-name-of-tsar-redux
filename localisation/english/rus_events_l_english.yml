By fully adopting a Constitutional Monarchy, Tsar's powers will be limited and shifted towards new Prime-Minister and the Duma. This will signify the end of dictatorial Russia. More radical advisors even suggest a full liberisation of regime.\n\nNonetheless, we could also pursue with our late Empreror Nikolai II's policy of Tsarist Russia with with Empreror of all Russians on the throne. \n\nSocialist coalition is led by Alexander Kerensky which favours a more republican Russia, Liberal coalition under Alexander Konovalov, Conservative coalition which Vladimir Nabokov as its representative and finally Tsar's coalition led by war hero Anton Denikin.\n\nWhich will it be?"
