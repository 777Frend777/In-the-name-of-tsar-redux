 SLV_grand_duchy_desc:0 "Following the Great War, the Balkan territories of the §gAustro-Hungarian Empire§! fell under the control of the Entente. The §GKingdom of Serbia§! annexed Bosnia and Croatia, and began advancing on the §2Slovene lands§! with the intention of incorporating the §gAustrian duchies§! of §2Carniola§! and Carinthia. The §GSerbian§! advance, unopposed by the weakened §gAustrian army§!, which was engaged on multiple fronts, proceeded smoothly, leading to the capture of §2Carniola§!. Anticipating further advances into Carinthia, §gAustria§! fortified its defenses along the Drava River. However, internal instability in the §GKingdom of Serbia§!, effective anti-Serb propaganda, and §gAustrian§! ceasefire with the Hungarian People’s Republic enabled §gAustria§!, with the support of §2pro-Austrian Slovene militias§!, to recapture the §2Duchy of Carniola§!.\nIn the aftermath of the war, §2Carniola§! was granted the Maribor region, renamed into §2Slovenia§!, and elevated to the status of a Grand Duchy. The §2Grand Duchy of Slovenia§! is now a highly autonomous entity within the §gHabsburg Monarchy§!, with governance vested in the §2Landtag§!."

 SLV_enemies_desc:0 "Although §gAustrian§! rule enjoys relative popularity among the §2Slovenian population§!, the influence of foreign interests continues to grow steadily. The §GChetniks§!, backed by the §GKingdom of Serbia§!, the §R Socialist Party of Slovenia§!, supported by the §RSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia§!, and the §gpro-Austrian majority§! remain deeply hostile toward one another. In some cases, individuals are willing to resort to violence against fellow citizens who align with factions they deem traitorous. This growing radicalization has led to an increase in national defense spending within the Landtag."
