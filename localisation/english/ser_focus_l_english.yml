 SER_military_access_non_aggression_desc:0 "The entirety of the Balkans have numerous threats, from the Austrians in the North, to the Italians in the West, to the Ottomans in the East.

 SER_fortification3:0 "Southern Border"
 SER_fortification3_desc:0 "Greece is a fairly passive country, with one exception: Makedonija. Greece has been pressing us to either cede the land to them or to rename the region. We certainly aren't going to do either. Building forts on our Southern border is a necessary precaution."

 SER_austrian_tactics:0 "Superior Austrian Tactics"
 SER_austrian_tactics_desc:0 "While our military hasn't had any grand army development in the last years our neighbouring state did. Sending officers to learn new tactics in Austria is essential for the army development."

 SER_take_bulgaria_desc:0 "Bulgaria was once an enemy. They tried to steal our lands in the Second Balkan War and tried it again in WW1 with the Central Powers. Bulgaria has been now crippled.
