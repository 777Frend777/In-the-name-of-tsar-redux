 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 Occident_NAME:0 "A Troubled Occident"
 ORIENT_NAME:0 "A Rising Orient"
 Occident_DESC:0 "Even after the Great War, Europe has not seen her last conflicts yet. Different German states are racing for control over the former Empire, with the main contenders being monarchist Prussia and communist Bavaria. In the east, Russia appears stronger than ever, but this house of cards may be easily toppled. To the west, the old Entente alliance is dealing with internal struggles. Only time will tell what the future holds for Europe..."
 ORIENT_DESC:0 "Even after the Great War, the East has not experienced peace, with the Great Game persisting between London and Saint Petersburg. This conflict has extended to the Middle East and Northern China. Nevertheless, there is hope for the East to rise again; Russia may be strong, but Japan is not weak, and the escalating tensions in India and Arabia will not be easily quelled."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_Occident_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France. With the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_Occident_DESC:0 "France lost an exuberant amount of men during the Great War. The combination of its loss in men and the Paris Stock Crisis in 1926 resulted in Europe's weaker economies utterly collapsing. The French have been in recovery since then, and their recovery is nearing completion. However, the governmental crises are long from over. To the left, Jaques Duclos is rallying socialists and communists, seeking to create a proletarian dictatorship. To the right, Pierre-Étienne Flandin is rallying to restore one of France's former royal houses. This era in French history will be one for the history books."
 GER_Occident_DESC:0 "The German Empire and its allies suffered a major defeat in the Great War, after shamefully losing in both the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of Königsberg. The former German Empire was divided into numerous fractured states, crippling the economy of Prussia. Luckily, Tsar Nicolas II insisted on preserving the House of Hohenzollern on the Prussian throne. Hopefully their coopeeration with Prussia continues..."
 ITA_Occident_DESC:0 "Italy was one of the victors of the Great War. The Italians have developed new weaponry and have become even stronger and progressively more modern. The King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III, wants expansion in Africa. However, a new movement known as fascism led by Benito Mussolini is rising. Mussolini's paramilitary "Blackshirts" want to restore the glory of the Roman Empire, with Italy as the epicentre of its rebirth. Italy is at a crossroads, and it's anyone's guess as to what will happen."
 JAP_Occident_DESC:0 "Japan was luckily caught on the right side of the Great War. It's victories have been powerful and plentiful. However, their next expansion policy puts them at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, or the "Northern Expansion Doctrine", is favoured by the Army and calls for further expansion into their former enemy, Russia. Nanshin-ron, or the "Southern Expansion Doctrine", is supported by the Navy and has the resource-abundant Western colonies in Southeast Asia and the Oceania as its target. Whichever path Japan chooses is equally likely to bring the Emperor to glory."
 RUS_Occident_DESC:0 "Russia has shown itself to be a major power via the Great War. They were able to defeat a coalition of Austro-Hungarian and German forces in the Brusilov Offensive in October of 1916. A separate peace was signed between the Habsburgs and the Tsar, leaving the German Empire isolated in the Great War. Germany, fearing the complete and utter destruction of its empire, sued for peace and an armstice was declared in January of 1917. Russia has since recovered from the Great War, but several new threats are on the horizon, from Japan's ambitions in Siberia to the Communists in Bavaria, to even the Russian people themselves."
 USA_Occident_DESC:0 "The United States was an industrial powerhouse during the Great War, arming the Entente. Ultimately, however, they kept themselves out of the war. After the end of the Great War, the US turned to what is referred to as the Harding Doctrine: absolute, undisturbed isolation. This doctrine has proved to be a failure, however, as the American economy has been tumbling down a cliff. With the sudden rise of the Socialist Party, and Hoover’s impeachment in 1934, the upcoming election may prove to be more consequential and divisive than the election of Lincoln, more than half a century ago."
 BEL_Occident_DESC:0 "The story of Belgium from 1914 to 1936 is a story of survival. The Belgians had to fend off the German attack on their homeland, witness their fields and towns getting destroyed, and afterwards faced major economic problems. However, they did survive, and their economy is now beginning to look better. However, some people think this is not going far and fast enough, and are looking for alternative political roads...."
 OTHER_Occident_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 #POL_Occident_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 #CAN_Occident_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 #AST_Occident_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 #SAF_Occident_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 #NZL_Occident_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 #RAJ_Occident_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 BAV_Occident_DESC:0 "After the division of Germany by the Entente Powers, the democratic state of Bavaria with its Wittelsbach king quickly fell in a Marxist revolution in April of 1919, becoming the Bavarian People's Republic. It quickly spread its influence to the neighbouring state of Baden-Wuttenberg making the state its ally in the German Civil War. Bavaria wants to once again reunite Germany, however, with one stipulation: under the crimson flag of Marxism. With Karl Liebknecht at the helm, they will fight the oppressive bourgeoisie to spread the superior ideology of communism throughout the world, no matter what the cost."
 AUS_Occident_DESC:0 "The defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire meant the end of their plurinational empire. Thanks to the Russian Tsar, however, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine was preserved. New states such as Bohemia and Hungary have emerged, but their future is uncertain. The Austrian nation currently sits at a crossroads: either they reunify their empire... or they reunify Germany themselves."
 TUR_Occident_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire was dismantled by the Entente powers in 1922. Its successor, the Turkish Republic, was established as the direct successor to what was left of the "sick man of Europe". The new and highly unstable government is trying to maintain their Anatolian identity, but resistance seems to be futile. One small taste of expansion is all Turkey needs to empower Ottoman nationalists who have one main goal: to restore the glory of Suleiman the Magnificent".
 SER_Occident_DESC:0 "Serbia emerged victorious after the Great War, but at a devastating cost. The Serbian population has had so many casualties that they have lost one fifth of their population. The instability and vacant job positions have divided the nation into two halves: those who want to unite the Southern Slavic people under their king, Alexander II, and those who follow the Bavarian-inspired politican, Josef Broz Tito. What path will the Serbs choose?"
 CHI_Occident_DESC:0 "China was one of many nations who joined the Entente during the Great War. Their victories would be short lived, however. The Chinese nation has been fractured beyond belief. On one side, the Kuomintag government. On the other, the Bavarian-inspired Communists. The Chinese army is outdated since the Xinhai revolution, and everyone in China fears a potential Japanese invasion. Not to mention, with the threat of a potential famine in China, the nations is desperate for a change. China is on the verge of collapse."
 WUT_Occident_DESC:0 "The Duchy of Baden-Wurttemberg was created by the French as a buffer state, nothing more. Its sole role is to protect and serve as a cushion between France and the Southern Commune. Whilst its people are more affiliated with communism, the government remains neutral. Its location and the dispute between its people and its government are rife for a conflict, and it seems as though the Duchy may be Bavaria's next target."
 RHN_Occident_DESC:0 "The Confederation of the Rhine was originally a French client state after the Great War. However Franco-Rheinish relations worsened after the French invasion of the Moselland and the Saarland, and its subsequent integration into France. The Confederation is still under democratic rule, but its people overall are more favourable towards the Prussian government. Its steel exports allow the Rhine to remain industrially competitive and relatively wealthy, despite the turbulance within the remainder of Germany."
 SAX_Occident_DESC:0 "The Saxonian borders were defined by the Treaty of Brussels. It was believed by the Entente that splitting German industrial capacity will greatly restrict its ability to wage war in the future. Saxony, however, is allied to Prussia, after many agreements and formation of Berlin Pact. It's government is essentially a vassal of Prussia, and the people of Saxony are just sitting around waiting for the Prussians to ask for their annexation."
 WSM_Occident_DESC:0 "The Republic of Hanover, or known by most as Hanover, was founded in 1917. Out of all German nations, it is the youngest. The region it inhabits was mainly part of Prussia, and as such has never had the amount of autonomy it has now. Nonetheless, it is the second most powerful nation economically in the region, only before Prussia itself. Its annexation by Prussia is highly likely, as its people are greatly supportive of further Berlin Pact integration."
 SPR_Occident_DESC:0 "Spain has been in a state of turmoil since the close of the Napoleonic Wars. Since the beginning of the 19th century, the people of Spain have been under a monarchy, followed by a republic, followed by another monarchy, and followed by the current republic. The exiled King of Spain, Alfonso XIII, longs to return to the throne of Spain from his exile in the city of Rome. Both far left and far right parties have gained considerable influence within Spain, and the people have been split right down the middle. The future of Spain is unclear, but one thing is for sure: these elections will decide the fate of Spain with the remainder of the 20th century."
 POR_Occident_DESC:0 "Portugal is at an important crossroad in its history. Antonio Salazar has governed Portugal with total control, for 13 years now. Calls for Democracy are increasing ever more in the nation and the military fears the downfall of power through Salazar's future actions. Will Salazar give in, to the people's demands and reestablish elections or will he solve this problem with forces.  The Estado Novo is nearing its end."
 HUN_Occident_DESC:0 "Hungary gained its independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the early 1918 after the defeat of Habsburg forces by the Russian army. In the Treaty of Brussels, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. To make things worse, newly established socialist government is threatened by nationalist and fascist organizations within the country. \nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "World at War"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The time of peace is at its end. Austria is about to invade the Hungarian People's Republic, while their German allies are looking to avenge their loss during the Great War. Meanwhile the Russians are taking advantage of the Sino-Japanese war, and planning to snatch Japanese-controlled Manchuria from right under their nose. There are however, new contenders in this race for power, as both the Italian and Ottoman Empires are aiming to restore their past glory. A second Great War is about to unfold..."
 FTU_Occident_DESC:0 "France currently is the 2nd biggest colonial power in the world. However, in order for them to keep a grasp on this power, they have created colonial administrations. \nThese administrations are currently at a crossroads. Either they can stay loyal to France, or rebel against their masters, establishing a new, non-colonial order. \nThe choice is yours."
 SWE_Occident_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Sweden have, since the Napoleonic wars, been mostly neutral in the European theater. The last half of the 19th century saw Sweden modernize. But the time leading up to the great war also saw Norway gain their independence, weakening the Swedish influence in Scandinavia. After the Great War, Sweden became a regional industrial power, with steel and other resources being found in the country. 1936, sees a Sweden that continues on the path of neutrality, but that might not be for forever..."
 ROM_Occident_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Romania has joined the Entente powers in 1916 in an attempt to regain Transylvania from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However after the success in Brusilov Offensive, the Russian army remained in Romania, de facto making it under its occupation.\nSince then Russia has tied Romania to its economy and made it a satellite state. This has not however made the Romanians happy, a new nationalist movement emerges and the future of Romania under Russian rule is uncertain..."
# ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
# FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
# GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
# JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
# ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
# RUS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
# USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
# OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
