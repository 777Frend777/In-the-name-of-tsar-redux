portu.1.t:0 "Portugal gives up its Colonial Empire"
portu.1.d:0 "The collapse of the Estado Novo and the reestablishment of the Portuguese Republic was a relieve for the western nations and another victory for democracy. But who could have predicted that this reborn Republic would go a path, no over Democratic Nation had gone before? Yesterday the government of Portugal announced that it would end its imperial ambitions and begin to give its colonies around the world independence. While socialist and believer of human rights celebrate this announcement, Portuguese Conservatives and Nationalists are furious about the decision. With the proclamation that every human is free by right and a government actively implementing that policy, a new wave has started around Europe. The other Empires of the world are now worrying about what effect this has on their colonies."
portu.1.a:0 "A milestone in history!"

portu.2.t:0 "The Estado Novo Dictatorship falls!"
portu.2.d:0 "The oppressive Estado Novo Dictatorship in Portugal has been suffering under worker strikes and protests demanding the dictators to step down and open elections. The economy and stability of Portugal were been severly suffering under these demonstrations and observer thought that Salazar would soon response with force. But to all suprise, the regime gave in, fearing a civil war bigger then all before. Democracy is now reestablished in Portugal and elections are set in a few weeks which will determine the future path of the nation. "
portu.2.a:0 "Congratulation to the Portuguese People"

portu.3.t:0 "Portuguese Monarchy Restored!"
portu.3.d:0 "Portugal has not been a nation of stability in the last decades. The new republic in 1910 after the fall of the Monarchy, was politcally incompetent and suffered several miltiary coups. In the 20s the last bit of democracy was lost with the rise of the Estado Novo. But Salazars Regime was also not enough to stabilize the country and silence the call for rights. With the recent removal of Salazar, the authoritarians have lost their power base. Since the fall of the monarchy, Portugal has been suffering instability without end, so the Portuguese Miltiary decided to reestablish the monarchy." 
portu.3.a:0 "The Return of the King"

portu.4.t:0 "The Portuguse Commune requests entry into the Comintern"
portu.4.d:0 "The Spartacist Revolution has now also suceeded in Portugal. The new Commune has arisen out of the fall of Salazars regime and demolished military resistance. The Portuguese Commune is now consolidating their power and is readying to maintain the spread of socialism in the entire Iberian Penisula. For this they require our support and are ensuring us, military support in any future campaigns for the Comintern"

Citizens of Portugal. I am not ignorant to my people and do believe that you have heard of the chaos within our armed forces. We have held back intel on these events for several weeks now so that we would be able to prevent counter setbacks and panic. But no longer shall I be silent, as it is my duty to tell my people what has been happening in the last days. When I was given the crown of Portugal back, I was not given it by you the people but by autocratic generals. Those Generals and officers hoped to continue their power abusing lifestyle through me as a figurehead. But I had not come back to my country as a puppet to enjoy fame and riches. This country has been living under military suppression for nearly  two decades now, hurting the future of this great nation. I came back to rule and bring back the old glory and for that to happen the ones who were responsible needed to face justice. A military purge throughout our armed forces has taken place, removing corrupt and opposing generals and officers. Soldiers, I have not taken away your ability to fight, I have given you a cause to serve. Citiziens of Portugal, the Restoration of the Kingdom is now complete. Long live Portugal."
portu.5.a:0 "All glory to our King!"

portu.6.t:0 "New Concordat between Portugal and the Vatican signed"
portu.6.d:0 "Roman Catholicism is a major part of this country identity. In the first Constitution of 1822 we officially declared the Catholicism our state religion. But in 1910 the Republican Revolution abolished several ties between the state and the church and also restricted the church in inhuman ways. Not only were Church properties seized and education secularized, but the Republic went so far as to ban the ringing of church bells, the wearing of clerical garb on the streets, and the holding of many popular religious festivals. While the Salazar government improved of these issues, it was never able to fully solidify the status of Roman Catholicism in Portugal. Our returned King, a strong believer in Roman Catholicism himself, has taken up the task personally to solve this problem. Now a new Concordat governing Church–State relations has been signed between Portugal and the Vatican. Roman Catholism has again now become the State Religion furthermore many of the anticlerical policies adopted during the First Republic were reversed. King Manuel the Second has gained praise and support from the puplic especially from conservatives and rural, areas for this act. The friendship betwenn Portugal and the Catholic Church has been restored in a comfortable and mutually reinforcing manner. May our Kingdom flourish from it."
portu.6.a:0 "Amen, God with Portugal"

portu.7.t:0 "Assasination attempt on the King!"
portu.7.d:0 "On this day our King Manuel the Second nearly avoided his death. While driving with his royal escort through the streets of Lisbon, a man passed the security and was about to shot the royal car with an submachine gun. Luckily the royal guards were able to disarm the assasin before he was able to kill the king. This assasination attempt reminds us all of the Lisbon Regicide of 1908 when King Carlos and Luís Filipe were killed by Republican Revolutnaries. King Manuel had tried negotiating with Republican and Socialist Politicians about setting up a new parliamantary government, despite the Republicans overthrewing him in 1910. But our King now sees that there is no hope in negotiating a peaceful constitutional monarchy when democratic and socialists movements are still willing to use violent measures to achieve their goals. Many see the Revolution of 1910 being only successful because the Monarchy was not willing to impose its will upon the Republicans, it is now unlikely that a parliamantary goverment will be restored by the monarchy."

Salazar was able to set a date for parliamentary elections in the next 3 months. Now ideological movements will begin their campaigns to gain or regain control of the state. Salazar is trying to form a conservative christian party with which he hopes to regain control of the government once again. In response several old republicans, supporters of the revolution and liberals have formed a 'Democratic Party' to oppose Salazar. Not all Republicans joined this new party though, several leftist republicans see it similiar to the old republican party which was not able to hold together after the revolution. And so they formed the Democratic Leftwing Republican Party. This party only gains partial support especially from the workers who rather see in a opportunity in the new legalised Communist Party by Bento Gonçalves. Salazar has the best chances to win compared to his fractured opposition, right now. But through mistakes and political moves anything can happen."
