  MAC_ivan_mihajlov_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! August 26th, 1896, in Novo Selo, Vilayet of Kosovo, Ottoman Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Ivan Mihajlov was born to a Bulgarian speaking family in the mountains of Macedonia. A region soon ripped and torn by ethnic tensions and war. Even his life is a good glimpse into rapid-fire changes which the region had to endure. Mihajlov began his studies in a Bulgarian men's high school in Thessaloniki before it was closed by the Greek administration during the First Balkan War. Thus he briefly transferred to a Serbian one in Skopje, before finally finishing his education in Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia. Finally moving on to study law in Sofia. During the Weltkrieg, Mihajlov enlisted in the Bulgarian army, and came into personal contact with IMRO leader Todor Aleksandrov.\n\nAfter the war, Mihajlov became Aleksandrov's personal secretary. The IMRO, having accomplished its goals at last, dissolved. To consolidate their gains, Aleksandrov led Mihajlov and the right-wing faction of the organisation into the "Association Against Serbian Bandits". A paramilitary organisation tasked with eradicating Serbian resistance and paving the way for the Bulgarisation of the Western Provinces. In time, the Association transformed into the Ohrana, an intimidating Macedonian paramilitary and a far-right haven.\n\nIn 1930, injured by a Serbian Chetnik ambush, Aleksandrov retired from an active role in the organisation. His protege Mihajlov assumed his stead. He fully embraced Ohrana's alliance with the National Legions and volunteered for the Fourth Balkan War alongside hundreds of his peers. When the war ended with his home seized by the Serbs yet again, he chose to follow his mentor's footsteps. Alongside his fellow Macedonian veterans and refugees, Mihajlov infiltrated the Serbian-Bulgarian border and proclaimed the restoration of the IMRO. Intent to free Macedonia from the oppressors in Belgrade no matter how much blood is shed along the way."
 
 #focuses and ideas
 IMRO_idea: "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation"
 IMRO_idea_desc: "Many decades ago, the IMRO sowed fear in the hearts of Ottoman Turks and Serbs, using partisan tactics and terrorism to liberate Macedonia from any foreign tyrant. A new generation has grown up in free Bulgaria, but today, now that the Serbs have once again subjugated the Vardar Valley, they will have to prove themselves to be as vicious as their forefathers. Freedom or Death!"
