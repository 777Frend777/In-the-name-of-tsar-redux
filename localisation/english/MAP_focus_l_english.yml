 mandate.10.t:0 "Arab General Strike"
 mandate.10.d:0 "The Arab community in Palestine is on strike! They are demanding changes in the Mandate’s policies, namely limiting Jewish immigration and limiting the purchase of Arab land by Jews. Those within the government who are calling for a violent crackdown are becoming more and more fervent as the strikes become increasingly violent to both the government and the Jewish population."
 mandate.10.a:0 "We may need help."
 mandate.11.t:0 "The Peel Commission"
 mandate.11.d:0 "Following the Arab General Strike and increasing violence in Palestine, the British have sent Lord Peel to investigate the causes of the strike as well as the motives of the conflicting Arabs and Jews in the Mandate. Due to the investigation, the Arab General Strike has been called off and most of the violence seems to have abated. "
 mandate.11.a:0 "We will await the commission’s report."
 mandate.12.t:0 "The Peel Commission Publishes its Report"
 mandate.12.d:0 "After a year of review, the Peel Commission has concluded. Its report does not bode well. The commission has determined that “An irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national communities within the narrow bounds of one small country. There is no common ground between them. Their national aspirations are incompatible. The Arabs desire to revive the traditions of the Arab Golden Age. The Jews desire to show what they can achieve when restored to the land in which the Jewish nation was born. Neither of the two national ideals permits of combination in the service of a single State.” Strikes and revolts have resumed as both Arab and Jewish militias work to better arm themselves for the coming fight."
 mandate.12.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 mandate.13.t:0 "The White Paper"
 mandate.13.d:0 "The unrest of the Arab Revolt has prompted the British parliament to approve the White Paper, a policy calling for limiting Jewish immigration into Palestine, and preventing the sale of land from Arabs to Jews. The White Paper also stipulates the creation of a Jewish state within the next 10 years. Due to these new limitations, the Zionist community is outraged. Meanwhile, the Arab leadership, contrary to British expectations, is split on the issue. Amin al-Husayni is the only major supporter from the Arab High Committee of this new policy."

 mandate.14.t:0 "Special Night Squads"
 mandate.14.d:0 "As our need for Special Forces grows, so does Orde Wingate’s desire to experiment with new tactics.

 mandate.15.d:0 "The last of the revolting militias have been destroyed, and with them the chaos of the Arab Revolt. Jewish militias now play an increasingly prominent role in the defense of the Mandate, and the Palestine Police Force has learned many new tricks from the fighting."
 mandate.15.a:0 "One less problem to worry about."

 mandate.16.t:0 "Restore Israel"
 mandate.16.d:0 "The British have recognized our continued service to the Empire, and we have earned independence. However, as long as we continue to be called 'Palestine', our independence feels bitter-sweet to many. However, if we simply declare ourselves Israel, the Arab world will likely try to wipe us off the map. We need a powerful nation to recognize the legitimacy of our declaration. One who we can count on to defend us from the Arab incursion. Who better than the British, our former overlords? If we offer immediate membership of the reborn Israel in their faction, their recognition should be guaranteed. A few Jews wish for the holy site of Mount Sinai to be granted to us as well. There’s little harm in letting a few of them tag along."
 mandate.16.a:0 "Send the delegation. If we are to be Israel, we need allies."


 israel.1.t:0 "Formation of the Israeli Defense Force"
 israel.1.d:0 "With the creation of our new nation, an army must also be created with it.

 israel.1.a:0 "We welcome them!"
 israel.3.t:0 "The Altalena Affair"
 israel.3.d:0 "Our government has worked hard to turn the many paramilitary organizations into the Israeli Defense Force. While the Irgun has resisted our efforts, until now, they have been fighting alongside the IDF. However, after their doomed efforts to use the Altalena to smuggle in French weapons for their fighters, and the uproar caused by the killing of Irgun members by the IDF in a dispute over these weapons, it is clear we can no longer allow a rogue army to function and make deals with foreign powers from within our borders."
 israel.3.a:0 "We should send them an ultimatum, “Join us or be destroyed.”"

 mandate.7.t:0 "A New High Commissioner"
 mandate.7.d:0 "Following former High Commissioner Wauchope’s retirement, the British have chosen Harold MacMichael to serve as his replacement as High Commissioner of the Mandate. Zionist leaders give sincere farewells to Wauchope, who is a Zionist himself. MacMichael will have a lot of work ahead of him if he wishes to effectively rule over the conflicting peoples living in the Mandate."
