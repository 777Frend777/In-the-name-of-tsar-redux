While never fully liking Austrian rule, Slovenia still greatly prospered during the latter decades and never suffered huge discrimination. To avoid more conflict between Austria, Croatia and Italy the allied powers compromised. Austria would be able to keep Slovenia, with provinces being able to vote on autonomy. In the end the province of Ljubljana gained autonomy while Lower Styria, with its bigger german population, was fully integrated into Austria.
