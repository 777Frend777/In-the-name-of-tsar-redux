Outdated equipment, inadequate training, and low morale plagued the military, leaving Syria vulnerable to security threats. Urgent efforts to rebuild and strengthen the army were initiated to overcome these deficiencies and defend the nation effectively. In addition to the defeat against Israel, Syria also faced the occupation of Hatay by Turkey, adding further strain to the nation's security and sovereignty. This dual setback demanded even greater resolve from the Syrian leadership to address the military's shortcomings and regain control over the occupied territory."

The idea of a "Circo-Armenian Empire" also needs to be evaluated for its feasibility and the interests of all parties involved.
