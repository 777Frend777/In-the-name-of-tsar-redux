The main reason why France has chosen to leave the Confederacy is most likely the high occupation costs which led to dissatisfaction by the French and Rhenish public.\n\nAt the same time, in [GER.GetName], the government has already annouced its plans to begin reunification with its historic region. There are however, no plans to hold a plebisite in the region of Ruhr and it seems like its fate has already been decided by its neighbouring politicians."
