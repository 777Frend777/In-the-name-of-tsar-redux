The officers, who traditionally aligned with the Tsar, created their own political bloc and staged a coup in 1934. This coup was later faced with mounting political pressure from figureheads within the nation and brought the Tsar back to power. With almost unlimited power, Tsar Boris will have to repair the nation by hand."

#in beta bulgaria_news.17.d:0 "The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, signed in the aftermath of the Great War, has been revoked by the Bulgarian government. This move, though brash, was expected by many in the political scene in the next few years. The treaty enforced long lasting reparations and limitations on the size of the Bulgarian army; however, the heavily nationalist Bulgaria could no longer withstand the stress of being contained by a piece of paper. The League of Nations has been rather mute on the issue, choosing to follow a policy of appeasement and isolation. The Bulgarian foreign minister spoke on behalf of the decision earlier today: 'The war reparations have been paid off and peace for our generation in Europe has been established. There is no fear any nation in Europe should have towards our decision. We are merely executing the will of the people'."

An independent journalist dug up the family records of Pavelic's wife and made a shocking discovery: she is Jewish through the maternal line. A man who has dedicated his life towards stopping the Jewish and Serbian menace is now guilty in continuing the Jewish race by having three children with his Jewish wife. A swift putsch in now underway in Zagreb, led by Matija Canic. They are only minutes away from you, sir. They are going to kill for being a Jew lover. Oh God, they're coming through the door!"

Amedeo hails from the House of Savoy, earning his name from his service in the Abbsynian War. He seems like a great choice; however there are worries about his ability to be manipulated by fascists. Next is the German propsect, Fredrich Christian. Fredrich Christian is from the House of Schaumberg-Lippe and is an SS officer in Germany. The few non Party of Rights members who are voting propose Henry, brother of George VI of Britain. The final candidate dates back centuries, Maximillian. Maximillian is the son of Franz Ferdinand, who's death triggered the bloodiest war the world has ever scene. Maximillian was excluded from the Habsburg succession line as his father's marriage was morgantic. Everyone is uneasy over each candidate, but a conclusion must be reached."

 CRO.1.d:0 "As stated in the Illyrian Constitution, parliamentary elections shall occur every four years on the Fourteenth of May. Parliament is split into three factions. First is the IPPP, a conservative faction with a strong backing from farmers and Croatians. Next is the Party of Rights led by the first president of Illyria, Anton Korosec. The Party of Rights promotes smaller government and neutrality in foreign matters. Lastly is the Catholic League, an ultra-nationalist and fascist paramilitary organization led by Ante Pavelic. Polls have been inconclusive in the results, though showing a slight advantage for the Peasants Party."

The factory will employ around 300 people and another 500 people to make it. These are high numbers given that Požega, the town the factory is based in, only has 10,000 residents.

The suffering under the rule of the Austrians and the Ottomans is now over at last. Today we drink our Karlovačka beer and Rakija as we watch our glorious military march in a parade in every major city.

 CRO.6.d:0 "Reserves had to be mobilized today in Zagreb as the largest political confrontation in our history took place. The Ustasha militia has long planned a march down Ilica Street in Zagreb. During this time, a ragtag coalition of Jews, Serbs, anarchists, and communists planned to bring the parade to a halt in an act of defiance. The Ustasha expected hostile company to the parade and were more than ready for a battle. The Ustasha were about to approach the statue of Josip Jelačić when they came across a wooden barricade. The barricade spread from one side of the street to the other and about 3.5 meters tall. It was crudely constructed with: old tables, cabinets, tipped-over carts, and chairs. On the top of the barricade were red and black flags along with one Soviet flag. The communists waited until the Ustasha were within throwing range, where they began to bombard them with firebombs and rocks. One of the men at the barricade threw a makeshift shrapenel grenade, killing 14. The Ustasha returned fire with revolvers for around 5 minutes. Then a torchbearer in the Ustasha parade ran at the barricade, throwing his torch into the barricade. The wooden barricade quickly caught fire while the brave torchbearer was bombarded by three firebombs. The communists, anarchists, Jews, and Serbs quickly dispersed as many were caught in the fire. When the army arrived on the scene, 103 were killed, most of which were communists, and 43 wounded. Now it is the prime minister's job to respond the confrontation."

Even before our independence, Anton Bauer has served as Archbishop of Zagreb. He has stood as a symbol of our predominant faith and unity of an Illyrian people.  Earlier today, after 23 years of service, Bauer has passed away peacefully in his sleep. Today is a national of morning; however, this didn't stop the KZ from using his death for political gains. Their newspaper, Ilirski Katolik, has even sparked a rumor that Bauer was assassinated by 'second-class Serbs and Jews'. Despite the lack of evidence supporting this claim, this hasn't stopped Ilirski Katolik readers from committing arson of Serbian property."

 CRO.8.t:0 "The Battle of Tuzla"
 CRO.8.d:0 "It was 1921 on August 5 when the Battle of Tuzla began. Four days prior the Serbs invaded Srem and Central Bosnia in an attempt to extend their post-Great War gains. The war was hopeless as the Illyrian army was merely a ragtag gang of militias and British soldiers who were late for their ship out. In Srem, the Serbs were met by scorched fields and dehydration from the late-Summer heat. In Bosnia, the mountainous terrain destroyed Serbian supply lines and whatever navigated the mountains were ambushed. Tuzla, a town 24 miles into Illyrian territory, was the site of a battle between various Bosniak militias and the Central Serbian Army under Stepa Stepanović. It was 800 defenders versus over 3500 Serbian soldiers. Inaccurate maps and poor scouting made the Serbian army approach Tuzla from the West. The defenders dug trenches and created makeshift barricades in advance as a scout reported their movements. The battle began at 6:13 am with Serbs confidant in a decisive victory. All went well for the Serbs until the Sun rose in the East, hindering the Serbian vision. The defenders capitalized on this and thwarted the Serbian advance for a day. In this time, a relief force approached the Serbs from behind after three days of fighting. Encircled and losing men rapidly, the Serbs surrendered. This was the first victory for Illyria and soon after the nation stabilized and repulsed the invasion. Historians compare this to a modern-day David and Goliath story. It is the second largest national holiday in Illyria, only rivaled by National Day."

Amedeo quickly accepted and soon arrived in Split by ship with his wife Duchess Anne. They were welcomed by a resounding applause from not just KZ members, but by a majority of Split. They settled down in Zagreb and were met with handshakes from Pavelic and General Kvaternik. He adopted the name Tomislav II after the first King of Croatia. While the newly appointed Tomislav II isn't entirely supportive of the fascist cause, he serves as a liaison between the KZ and Italy."

 YD_news.4.d:0 "When the Treaty of Trianon was signed, the remnants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was due to pay the Illyrian people 2 million Krones and 7500 rifles as a means to kickstart the new nation. Rapid inflation, civil strife, and a brief civil war in the 1920s have delayed the shipment of over 1200 Steyr rifles to Illyria. After a long night of negotiations by Austrian, Illyrian, British, Hungarian, Italian, German, and French diplomats, the final shipment arrived in Carniola the following morning. While the guns may be outdated, it serves as a figurative end to the bloodiest conflict Europe has ever seen."
