The officers, who traditionally aligned with the Tsar, created their own political bloc and staged a coup in 1934. This coup was later faced with mounting political pressure from figureheads within the nation and brought the Tsar back to power. With almost unlimited power, Tsar Boris will have to repair the nation by hand."

Armed with the Laser Vision Implants from 6000 AD, Slobodan Milošević can wipe out millions of people in a second on his own. He was welcome to Belgrade with pure awe as anyone who questioned him was disintegrated. His first action in office was to unite all of Yugoslavia, through means of warfare. There is no way to beat his Laser Vision, all is lost."

There is no way to beat his laser vision, all is lost."




Bulge.500.d:0 "The war so far has been less than favorable. Bulgaria has secured their claims in Thrace and are making an advance through Macedonia. Many in our war cabinet are beginning to question the feasibility of a Greek victory. They view surrendering to their claims as a necessity for our nation survival. However [GRE.GetLeader], if you deem we can still win the fight, we shall continue to despite their objections."

It was a matter of time before the people and the Old Guard of the military back the return of George II to power. A March on Athens with over 6000 armed men and tens of thousands of people led by George II are deposing our government, promising to end this bloody conflict."
Bulge.9999.d:0 "A joint deep state operation by Zaimov, SIR, and other military officers has enstated a Marxist state in Bulgaria. While many of the officers themselves disagree with the concept of class struggle in Marxism, they view Marxism as a means of securing absolute power with little opposition from the populace. Zaimov has been appointed as Supreme Secretary of Bulgaria with a thunderous applause from the residents of Sofia. Bulgaria is the latest state in the Marxist revolution, and hopefully not the last."

CRO.13.d:0 "With the election of Maximillian, there has always been an increase in relations between Austria and Illyria. However, now that Austria is now under the Illyrian Kingdom, many in the Party of Rights have speculated the crowning of Maximillian as the King of an Austro-Illyrian Kingdom, effectively integrating Austria into our nation and give us claim to territories beyond our borders. The notion passed the Sabor with only 7 nays. Long Live the King! Long Live Maximillian!"

An air force officer has been sent by the Tsar to the Jordan River to fetch water for Simeon's baptism. Simeon's birth was widely publicized, reinforcing monarchist tendencies in the nation."
 Bulge.9.d:0 "Nikola Zhekov served as the commander-in-chief of our armed forces during the Great War. He fled into exile after the disgraceful defeat and only returned in the 20s to defend whatever reputation he has left. As a new war approaches, should we consider offering him his old job back? Despite the defeats, he clearly has skill- especially compared to our current officers."
 
 Bulge.10.d:0 "In the April Fools Edition of Trud, our first weekly newspaper, a front page headline detailed 'Latvian Butter Knife Bandits'. Disregarding the fact Latvia doesn't border us and the Latvian nationals in our country is in the double-digits, the paper describes a gang of 20 Latvian soldiers that brutally assaulted a farmer with butter knives. The paper made sure to mention that the farmer made a full recovery but the suspects still roam the countryside.

The Bulgarian nodded- maniacally. While nodding in most of Europe indicates approval, in Bulgaria it means no. The Romanian was clearly not used to Bulgarian culture and stormed out of the meeting angry."

PFC Slavia Sofia easily breezed past Georgi Drazhev Yambol in the semifinals 6-0 and faced Ticha Varna in the finals. Similar to their domination in previous years, Slavia Sofia won easily 2-0."
 Bulge.13.d:0 "Vladimir Zaimov is one of our most talented officers; however, he has had a rocky history with us. Last year we had to arrest him for conspiracy against the state, charges we had to drop due to the lack of evidence as well as the influence the co-conspirators carried. Last week, Zaimov managed to avoid a conviction for the attempted murder of Damian Velchev. The SIR, our intelligence agency, has been preparing an investagation into Zaimov's life for a grand treason conviction. The investagation breaches various privacy laws and needs to ordered directly from the head of state."
 Bulge.14.d:0 "While looking at Zaimov's financial records, we have discovered a cardboard factory under his name. The purchase of the land as well as the construction of the factory are fishy to say the least and they may serve as a cover for a subversive cause of his. SIR agents armed with carbines are ready to raid the factory for info, though waiting could yield more substantial evidence."
 Bulge.15.d:0 "The raid on the cardboard factory was underwhelming. Nothing of any value was found regarding the investagation and the raid has been widely publicized in the press as 'a failure by the SIR'. Zaimov has demanded a warrant for the raid and we don't have any. The investagation can't continue."
 Bulge.16.d:0 "SIR has discovered that Zaimov's nephew, Evgeni Chemshirov, has been willing to cooperate with our investagation. Evgeni details a 1935 meeting between Zaimov and Colonel T.B. Suhoruukov of the Red Army. The two men discussed a possible Soviet-backed military coup that would put Zaimov as the Supreme Secretary of the nation. While the interrogation of Evgeni alone can't be used to convict Zaimov, it gives us a lead on Zaimov and his possible foreign loyalties."
 Bulge.17.d:0 "SIR agents outside Zaimov's home have witnessed a Soviet national and Zaimov conversing in Zaimov's dining room. While the details of the conversation are unknown, the Soviet matched the description of a Soviet who arrived in Varna last week under possibly fraudlent identification. We have a reason to suspect the Soviet is a spy sent by [SOV.GetLeader] to establish a Soviet dicatorship in Sofia. The evidence is stacking against Zaimov, but it isn't enough."
 Bulge.18.d:0 "A SIR agent under the name of Georgy Nikolovich managed to gain Zaimov's trust and begin a discussion about Zaimov's plans. Zaimov detailed to Georgy Operation Red Dawn, which would capitalize on the national instability and secure a military dicatorship with marxist characteristics, with Zaimov at the helm of course. At that instant, Georgy drew out his pistol and forced Zaimov to his knees. 6 more SIR agents emerged from nearby shrubery to send Zaimov to an undisclosed location and executed him. This is a decisive victory for SIR, establishing it as a serious intelligence agency."

Next is the German propsect, Fredrich Christian. Fredrich Christian is from the House of Schaumberg-Lippe and is an SS officer in Germany.

While initially seeking a pan-slavic union with the Kingdom of Serbia, a popular decision was made to remain independent. This has left a bitter taste in the mouth of the Kingdom of Serbia, who declared war on the new state in 1921. This war would be known as the Adriatic War and will go down as one of the greatest David and Goliath wars in history with a victory for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. We arrive in the year 1936 today, the ideals of Benito Mussolini and Hitler are fueling the politics of both nations as a dark cloud rapidly approaches Europe, the same cloud that engulfed Europe only two decades before. The fate of the Balkans will be determined in the next few years by you."
 
 stuff.7.d:0 "While originally the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, the nation has become known internationally as Illyria in 1923. Illyria, since its concept has been a multiethnic nation. The lack of a clear ethnic majority has created a disfunctional political system in the early years of Illyrian democracy. Regionalist factions representing each ethnicity dominated the Sabor, the legislative body of Illyria. Eventually the two fathers of Illyrian politics, Stjepan Radic and Anton Korosec, ideological opponents, united the regionalist parties into two predominant parties, the Peasants Party and the Party of Rights. The two men exchanged the precious prime minister seat for 18 years. The nation economically and politically has always relied on the British. Without the British, Illyria would've never existed. The overreliance on foreign aid caused the Stock Market Crash of 1929 to almost destroy the nation. This led to the rise in labor unions and ,accompanied with the rise of Mussolini, fascist movements. The largest of these is the Catholic Union, an clerical fascist organization led by Ante Pavelic. They are overwhelming xenophobic and anti-semetic, blaming Jews and Serbs for the recent downturn in the economy and the rise of Communism, both abroad and domestic. Politics are obviously becoming more and more polarized, making the future of Illyria uncertain."

 CRO_Ban_Non_Catholic_Unions_desc:0 "Unions are typically influenced by Leninist and Marxist revolutionary thought. We, as a state, can't have that.

Our military is unsure of any success in the early stages of war, but a policy of defeat in detail and scorched-earth defense could garner us enough time to wait for foreign backers, if they exist. Sir, should we surrender? Or fight to the bloody end?"

When shipbuilders unionize and strike and price for crops plummets, the economy is crippled. The social democratic policies of the Peasants party has attempted to heal this through taxation and subsidization; however, these are rather ineffective.

  CRO.1.t:0 "1936 Illyrian Elections"
 CRO.1.d:0 "As stated in the Illyrian Constitution, parliamentary elections shall occur every four years on the Fourteenth of May. Parliament is split into three factions. First is the IPPP, a conservative faction with a strong backing from farmers and Croatians. Next is the Party of Rights led by the first president of Illyria, Anton Korosec. The Party of Rights promotes smaller government and neutrality in foreign matters. Lastly is the Catholic League, an ultra-nationalist and fascist paramilitary organization led by Ante Pavelic. Polls have been inconclusive in the results, though showing a slight advantage for the Peasants Party."
 CRO.1.a:0 "Peasants Party is triumphant!"

 CRO.2.d:0 "This morning Stjepan Radić, founder and leader of the Illyrian People's Peasants Party, was found dead in his home. An autopsy performed after his death indicates that he died following a diabetic coma, a condition he has lived with for decades. He survived with his wife Marija and their 4 children: Milica, Miroslav, Vladimira, Branislava. The IPPP is in chaos after Radić's death. The party is split on choosing his successor. Half of the party rallies behind Vladko Macek, a loyal follower of Radić's philosophy, while the other half rallies behind Ivan Šubašić, a hero from the Great War. The future of the IPPP relies on their choice..."

 CRO.3.d:0 "Stock Cognac Medicinal is a company in Slavonia that specializes in strong alcoholic beverages; however, they recently decided to enter the chocolate and candy market by creating a large chocolate factory. The factory will employ around 300 people and another 500 people to make it. These are high numbers given that Požega, the town the factory is based in, only has 10,000 residents. This demonstrates industrialization that will soon spread to all Illyrians."

 CRO.4.t:0 "National Day!"
 CRO.4.d:0 "On this day, in 1918, we as Slovenes, Croats, Bosniaks, and Serbs, declared our independence. With aid from the British Empire, we were able to finalize our independence in the Treaty of Versailles. We fought for our own self-determination after 600 years of external influences. The suffering under the rule of the Austrians and the Ottomans is now over at last. Today we drink our Karlovačka beer and Rakija as we watch our glorious military march in a parade in every major city. In a time of war and famine, it's nice to take a day off and enjoy life while we can."

 CRO.6.t:0 "The Ilica Street Blockade"
 CRO.6.d:0 "Reserves had to be mobilized today in Zagreb as the largest political confrontation in our history took place. The Ustasha militia has long planned a march down Ilica Street in Zagreb. During this time, a ragtag coalition of Jews, Serbs, anarchists, and communists planned to bring the parade to a halt in an act of defiance. The Ustasha expected hostile company to the parade and were more than ready for a battle. The Ustasha were about to approach the statue of Josip Jelačić when they came across a wooden barricade. The barricade spread from one side of the street to the other and about 3.5 meters tall. It was crudely constructed with: old tables, cabinets, tipped-over carts, and chairs. On the top of the barricade were red and black flags along with one Soviet flag. The communists waited until the Ustasha were within throwing range, where they began to bombard them with firebombs and rocks. One of the men at the barricade threw a makeshift shrapenel grenade, killing 14. The Ustasha returned fire with revolvers for around 5 minutes. Then a torchbearer in the Ustasha parade ran at the barricade, throwing his torch into the barricade. The wooden barricade quickly caught fire while the brave torchbearer was bombarded by three firebombs. The communists, anarchists, Jews, and Serbs quickly dispersed as many were caught in the fire. When the army arrived on the scene, 103 were killed, most of which were communists, and 43 wounded. Now it is the prime minister's job to respond the confrontation."

 CRO.7.t:0 "Death of Bishop Bauer"
 CRO.7.d:0 "While there is a sizeable Muslim and Orthodox community in Illyria, the most significant religious figure is the Archbishop of Zagreb. Even before our independence, Anton Bauer has served as Archbishop of Zagreb. He has stood as a symbol of our predominant faith and unity of an Illyrian people.  Earlier today, after 23 years of service, Bauer has passed away peacefully in his sleep. Today is a national of morning; however, this didn't stop the KZ from using his death for political gains. Their newspaper, Ilirski Katolik, has even sparked a rumor that Bauer was assassinated by 'second-class Serbs and Jews'. Despite the lack of evidence supporting this claim, this hasn't stopped Ilirski Katolik readers from committing arson of Serbian property."
 CRO.7.a:0 "God rest his soul"
 
 CRO.8.t:0 "The Battle of Tuzla"
 CRO.8.d:0 "It was 1921 on August 5 when the Battle of Tuzla began. Four days prior the Serbs invaded Srem and Central Bosnia in an attempt to extend their post-Great War gains. The war was hopeless as the Illyrian army was merely a ragtag gang of militias and British soldiers who were late for their ship out. In Srem, the Serbs were met by scorched fields and dehydration from the late-Summer heat. In Bosnia, the mountainous terrain destroyed Serbian supply lines and whatever navigated the mountains were ambushed. Tuzla, a town 24 miles into Illyrian territory, was the site of a battle between various Bosniak militias and the Central Serbian Army under Stepa Stepanović. It was 800 defenders versus over 3500 Serbian soldiers. Inaccurate maps and poor scouting made the Serbian army approach Tuzla from the West. The defenders dug trenches and created makeshift barricades in advance as a scout reported their movements. The battle began at 6:13 am with Serbs confidant in a decisive victory. All went well for the Serbs until the Sun rose in the East, hindering the Serbian vision. The defenders capitalized on this and thwarted the Serbian advance for a day. In this time, a relief force approached the Serbs from behind after three days of fighting. Encircled and losing men rapidly, the Serbs surrendered. This was the first victory for Illyria and soon after the nation stabilized and repulsed the invasion. Historians compare this to a modern-day David and Goliath story. It is the second largest national holiday in Illyria, only rivaled by National Day."

 CRO.40.t:0 "The Italian King arrives"
 CRO.40.d:0 "In order to align ourselves with Italy, we have offered the throne of King of Illyria to the Duke of Aosta, Prince Amedeo. Amedeo quickly accepted and soon arrived in Split by ship with his wife Duchess Anne. They were welcomed by a resounding applause from not just KZ members, but by a majority of Split. They settled down in Zagreb and were met with handshakes from Pavelic and General Kvaternik. He adopted the name Tomislav II after the first King of Croatia. While the newly appointed Tomislav II isn't entirely supportive of the fascist cause, he serves as a liaison between the KZ and Italy."

 CRO_GER_ALLIANCE:0 "Alignment with Germany"
 YD_news.4.d:0 "When the Treaty of Trianon was signed, the remnants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was due to pay the Illyrian people 2 million Krones and 7500 rifles as a means to kickstart the new nation. Rapid inflation, civil strife, and a brief civil war in the 1920s have delayed the shipment of over 1200 Steyr rifles to Illyria. After a long night of negotiations by Austrian, Illyrian, British, Hungarian, Italian, German, and French diplomats, the final shipment arrived in Carniola the following morning. While the guns may be outdated, it serves as a figurative end to the bloodiest conflict Europe has ever seen."
