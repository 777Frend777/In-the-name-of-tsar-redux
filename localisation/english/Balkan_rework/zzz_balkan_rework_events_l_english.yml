 CRO.1.t:0 "1936 Illyrian Elections"
 CRO.1.d:0 "As stated in the Illyrian Constitution, parliamentary elections shall occur every four years on the Fourteenth of May. Parliament is split into three factions. First is the HPSS, a conservative faction with a strong backing from farmers and Croatians. The incumbent Prime Minister Vladko Macek took control of the HPSS after Stjepan Radic's retirement in 1932. Next is the ISA led by the first president of Illyria, Anton Korosec. ISS promotes smaller government and neutrality in foreign matters. Lastly is the Ustasha, an ultra-nationalist and fascist paramilitary organization led by Ante Pavelic. Polls have been inconclusive in the results, though showing a slight advantage for the HPSS."
 CRO.1.a:0 "Peasants Party is triumphant!"
 CRO.1.b:0 "Bosnians and Slovenians rally behind Korosec!"
 CRO.1.c:0 "Croatians and Italians back Pavelic!"
 
 CRO.2.t:0 "Stjepan Radić Dies!"
 CRO.2.d:0 "This morning Stjepan Radić, founder and leader of the Illyrian People's Peasants Party, was found dead in his home. An autopsy performed after his death indicates that he died following a diabetic coma, a condition he has lived with for decades. He survived with his wife Marija and their 4 children: Milica, Miroslav, Vladimira, Branislava. The IPPP is in chaos after Radić's death. The party is split on choosing his successor. Half of the party rallies behind Vladko Macek, a loyal follower of Radić's philosophy, while the other half rallies behind Ivan Šubašić, a hero from the Great War. The future of the IPPP relies on their choice..."
 CRO.2.a:0 "The IPPP chooses Macek"
 CRO.2.b:0 "The IPPP chooses Šubašić"
 
 CRO.3.t:0 "Chocolate Factory Opens In Slavonia!"
 CRO.3.d:0 "Stock Cognac Medicinal is a company in Slavonia that specializes in strong alcoholic beverages; however, they recently decided to enter the chocolate and candy market by creating a large chocolate factory. The factory will employ around 300 people and another 500 people to make it. These are high numbers given that Požega, the town the factory is based in, only has 10,000 residents. This demonstrates industrialization that will soon spread to all Croatians."
 CRO.3.a:0 "Yum Yum!"
 
 CRO.4.t:0 "National Day!"
 CRO.4.d:0 "On this day, in 1918, we as Slovenes, Croats, Bosniaks, and Serbs, declared our independence. With aid from the British Empire, we were able to finalize our independence in the Treaty of Versailles. We fought for our own self-determination after 600 years of external influences. The suffering under the rule of the Austrians and the Ottomans is now over at last. Today we drink our Karlovačka beer and Rakija as we watch our glorious military march in a parade in every major city. In a time of war and famine, it's nice to take a day off and enjoy life while we can."
 CRO.4.a:0 "I'm too drunk to read that!"
 
 CRO.5.t:0 "The Ilica Street Blockade"
 CRO.5.d:0 "Reserves had to be mobilized today in Zagreb as the largest political confrontation in our history took place. The Crusaders militia has long planned a march down Ilica Street in Zagreb. During this time, a ragtag coalition of Jews, Serbs, anarchists, and communists planned to bring the parade to a halt in an act of defiance. The Crusaders expected hostile partisans at the parade and were more than ready for a battle. The Crusaders were about to approach the statue of Josip Jelačić when they came across a wooden barricade. The barricade spread from one side of the street to the other and about 3.5 meters tall. It was crudely constructed with: old tables, cabinets, tipped-over carts, and chairs. On the top of the barricade were red and black flags along with one Soviet flag. The communists waited until the Crusaders were within throwing range, where they began to bombard them with firebombs and rocks. One of the men at the barricade threw a makeshift shrapenel grenade, killing 14. The Crusaders returned fire with revolvers for around 5 minutes. Then a torchbearer in the Crusaders parade ran at the barricade, throwing his torch into the barricade. The wooden barricade quickly caught fire while the brave torchbearer was bombarded by three firebombs. The communists, anarchists, Jews, and Serbs quickly dispersed as many were caught in the fire. When the army arrived on the scene, 103 were killed, most of which were communists, and 43 wounded. Now it is the prime minister's job to respond the confrontation."
 CRO.5.a:0 "The torchbearer sacrificed himself to stop the Zionist plot."
 CRO.5.b:0 "Remember the barricade!"
 nuke_dropped.14.t:0 "Atomic Bombing of Zagreb"
 nuke_dropped.14.a:0 "Marko is alive, he isn't dead as long as there are Serbs and Serbia alive"
 nuke_dropped.14.b:0 "The devastating power of modern war"
 nuke_dropped.14.c:0 "Oh no, my Zagreb!"
 nuke_dropped.14.d:0 "Today around the noon, Serbian fighters cleared the sky above Zagreb, paving the way to one of the most devastating inventions of the Human kind. The Serbian bombers carried and deployed a nuclear bomb, named "Kraljević Marko", after the, often romanticised, Serbian medieval noble and an epic hero, Marko Mrnjavčević.\n\nThe nuclear bomb has devastated the city but the highest country officials have fled the city after the first reports of a nuclear threat looming. The Illyrian morale is crushed and the Serbian victory in the Second Adriatic War is on the horizon."
 balkan.1.t: "Austria Pays Last War Reps"
 balkan.1.d: "When the Treaty of Trianon was signed, the remnants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was due to pay the Illyrian people 2 million Krones and 7500 rifles as a means to kickstart the new nation. Rapid inflation, civil strife, and a brief civil war in the 1920s have delayed the shipment of over 1200 Steyr rifles to Illyria. After a long night of negotiations by Austrian, Illyrian, British, Hungarian, Italian, German, and French diplomats, the final shipment arrived in Carniola the following morning. While the guns may be outdated, it serves as a figurative end to the bloodiest conflict Europe has ever seen."
 balkan.1.a: "Why did we have to pay the Illyrians?"
 balkan.1.b: "Forgiven- but not Forgotten"
 balkan.1.c: "Who Cares?"
