 usa.9.t:0 "Roosevelt vs Dewey"
 usa.9.d:0 "The presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt has already been exceptional in many ways. Despite his declining health and the unprecedented length of his presidency, he aspires to continue leading our country through the war effort. The Republicans have been limited in their choices of candidates due to many potential nominees serving in the war, but have chosen Governor Thomas E. Dewey to represent them.\n\nRoosevelt continues to have popular support, but many suspect he may not live to see the end of his term. But is that sufficient to grant Dewey a victory over the man who has taken us this far?"

Despite declining health, he has managed to retain much of the support which landed him the presidency previously, and is now campaigning for the Democrats again.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] is arguing that a change of leadership in America's sensitive situation would be irresponsible, which is somewhat ironic since the same claim was made before his previous victory over Roosevelt. Despite this, he may have a point."

General Douglas MacArthur, normally devoted to his military duties, has taken the opportunity to campaign for the Republican nomination while our nation is at peace and won. He is now challenging Roosevelt, supporting the conservative coalition.\n\nRoosevelt continues to be popular, but MacArthur's charisma and sense of duty has made a strong impression on voters. Does the military really know best?"
 usa.11.a:0 "Roosevelt and Truman will pull through."
 usa.11.b:0 "MacArthur is a man of peace as much as war."
 usa.12.t:0 "Campaign of Douglas MacArthur"
 usa.12.d:0 "To challenge Roosevelt's record-length presidency, the Republicans have looked to respected military commanders, hoping to find a potential candidate to take America through this war. General Douglas MacArthur has been a popular nominee among the conservatives, but he is also an indispensable asset in the ongoing conflict and has been reluctant to spend his time campaigning for the presidency.\n\nHe nevertheless remains one of the more promising conservative candidates and can perhaps be convinced to campaign to avoid getting a moderate Republican president. Is it worth the sacrifice?"
 usa.12.a:0 "MacArthur is needed more on the front lines than in the White House."
 usa.12.b:0 "We need him to challenge Roosevelt."
 usa.13.t:0 "Roosevelt Passes Away"
 usa.13.d:0 "Although President Roosevelt's health has been in decline for some time, his strong presidential campaign convinced many that he had many years left. However, the possibility of FDR's death while still in office has remained, and today he passed away after suffering a stroke. Vice-President Harry S. Truman has now taken the oath of office, requesting the support and prayers of the people. The old cabinet remains, and Truman has vowed to continue many of the policies of his predecessor."
