  GRK_join_comintern:0 "Join the Comintern"
  GRK_join_comintern_desc:0 "With our country finally closely linked to Bavaria, it's time for the final step: joining the Communist International, or "Comintern" for short. The Bavarians would be absolute fools to refuse this opporunity to further link Germany."

  GRK_world_recognition_desc:0 "Our state is the product of many treaties. Unfortunately, we still have never been officially recognised by the world community. It is time we change that.

  GRK_freicorps_desc:0 "The veterans of our army who fought in the Great War are the perfect men to call back to improve our army. Of course, this time, we'll make sure they're treated the best. After all, without them, we'd be obliterated by the French and the Russians."
  GRK_the_sr:0 "Establish Paramilitary Groups"
